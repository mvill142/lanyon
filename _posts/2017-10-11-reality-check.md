title: "Reality Check"
---

So before I get into my reality check, I just want to share some of my background story so you can get some context.  
I am a 20 year old college student majoring in English. When I was in high school, I took a bunch of dual-credit courses, so when I did enter college I already had a ridiculous amount of college credits.
Being a naive recent high school graduate, I didn't think much of it.
When I did end up meeting with my college advisor, she informed me that I was on track to graduate early, and I didnt really know how to feel abou that.
So I kind of buried that information in the back of my mind. *Out of sight, out of mind.* So fast foward to today. This is my 5th semester in college and I am slated to graduate in December.
I applied for graduation earlier this semester, and I started thinking about what exactly I wanted to after graduation. Ok, so more back story. I want to go to law school, but the law school that I want to attend doesn't accept Spring applications.
So, I don't really have any plans for next semester. I definitely want to do something productive, but there really arent any employers that want to hire for a full time short term position. Anyways, so I started thinking about that and I was getting really frustrated, overwhelmed, and stressed out, so I decided to just forget abou tit.
This morning when I was having a one-on-one with my boss I casually commented that I didn't really have any plans.
